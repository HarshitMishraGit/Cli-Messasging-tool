## Welcome to CLI Chat APP

This is a very simple application where we are going to see a little use of websockets.This can be deployed to a cloud server and can be also modified accroding 
to your needs.
    
dependencies-
    
    1. npm install net

## Connection 
To connect to a chatroom you have to enter the ip:port of that purticular chat room. For now it is only be operating on port 3000. But it can be modified to use
multiple chat room at a time.We are using **netcat** to connect to the server =>
    
    nc <ip_of_server> <port>

## Result of v1.0
